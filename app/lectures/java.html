          <h4><span class="fa fa-history"></span> History</h4>
          <br>
          <p>Software for early computers was primarily written in assembly language.</p>
          <p class="fragment">An assembly language is a low-level programming language for a computer in which there is a one-to-one correspondence between the language and the architecture's machine code instructions.</p>
          <p class="fragment">Assembly language is converted into executable machine code by an <em>assembler</em>.</p>

          <h4><span class="fa fa-puzzle-piece"></span> Assembly example</h4>
          <br>
          <pre>
            <code data-trim class="assembly">
move $v0, $a0					
beqz $a1, gcd_return
move $t4, $a0
move $a0, $a1
remu $a1, $t4, $a1
jal gcd
lw $a1, 8($sp)
lw $a0, 4($sp)
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p class="fragment">The assembler reads the source code row-by-row and replaces each label with the corresponding binary code.</p>

          <p class="fragment">Each architecture has its own assembly language!</p>

          <h4><span class="fa fa-plug"></span> Introducing the compilers</h4>
          <br>
          <p>With the constant hardware producers growth, it became necessary to contrive a way to reuse the same software on different kinds of CPUs.</p>
          <p class="fragment">Towards the end of the 1950s the first <b>compilers</b> were developed making the way straight for the <em>high-level</em> programming languages.</p>

          <h4><span class="fa fa-search"></span> Using the compiler</h4>
          <br>
          <img src="/pic/compilers.png" alt="compiler example">
          <p class="fragment">The source code is written once and compiled for each architecture.</p>

          <h4><span class="fa fa-plug"></span> Introducing the Java Virtual Machine</h4>
          <br>
          <p>The compiler introduction resolves the multiple implementation issue.</p>
          <p class="fragment">Anyway the programmers still need to compile their source code for each architecture.</p>
          <p class="fragment"><b>Java</b> programming language removes this burden by introducing the <b>Java Virtual Machine</b>.</p>

          <h4><span class="fa fa-plug"></span> Introducing the Java Virtual Machine</h4>
          <br>
          <p>The JVM is a an abstract computing machine, running as a process over a real machine, that execute any program compiled into Java bytecode.</p>

          <h4><span class="fa fa-code"></span> The Java Language</h4>
          <br>
          <p>Java is a concurrent, object-oriented programming language.</p>
          <p class="fragment">It is one of the most popular programming language in use, particulary for client-server web applications.</p>
          <p class="fragment">The language derives much of its syntax from C and C++.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4><span class="fa fa-cogs"></span> Java is object oriented</h4>
          <br>
          <p>Five are the concept to keep in mind to apply a pure object oriented programming approach:</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="fragment">everything is an object;</li>
            <li class="fragment">a program is a bunch of objects telling each other what to do by sending messages;</li>
            <li class="fragment">each object has its own memory made by other objects;</li>
            <li class="fragment">every object has a type;</li>
            <li class="fragment">all object of a particular type can receive the same messages.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4><span class="fa fa-smile-o"></span> Every object has an interface</h4>
          <br>
          <p>An interface defines the set of requests you can make to an object.</p>
          <img src="/pic/interface.png" alt="Object interface">
          <p class="fragment">Using this approach an object can be used as a service provider.</p>
